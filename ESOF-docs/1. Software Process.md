## Introduction ##

After a couple mails exchange with the developers we concluded that Bazel is a project already in use and is in continuously development aiming to open source the project. In this report, we will explain what Bazel is and development process in use.

## Project description ##

[Bazel] (http://bazel.io/) is an open source project from Google aiming to provide faster _builds_ of software. It is still in _beta_, but the goal is to achieve a stable version in May of 2016. The full detailed roadmap can be checked [here] (http://bazel.io/roadmap.html).
Everyone is welcome to support the project, but it is required to fulfill all the [requirements] (http://bazel.io/contributing.html). The programming language used to program the _BUILD files_ is [Skylark] (http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/concepts.html) which "is a superset of the core build language and its syntax is a subset of Python". When the project finishes, it will support [multiple programming languages] (http://bazel.io/docs/build-encyclopedia.html#Rules) (such as Java or C++). To get started, please check [here] (http://bazel.io/docs/getting-started.html) how to do it.

## Software Process ##

The software process used in Bazel project is "Incremental development and delivery". After a brief conversation with the contributors of this project, they stated that the [Bazaar model] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) is a good description of the software process used, and that usually falls under the Agile methodology category. They also claimed that Google uses OKRs for planning and expressing what the company, a team and each individual engineer wants to focus on in the next quarter. A good presentation about this process can be found on the [Google Ventures] (http://www.gv.com/lib/how-google-sets-goals-objectives-and-key-results-okrs) website.
Incremental development and delivery process constructs the system in increments and evaluates each increment before proceeding to the development of the next increment.
We noticed that the meetings are informal between the programmers. Also, there is the quater reunion to discuss the objects achieved in a more formal situation.

## Comment about Software Process used ##

This process seems to be the more adequate and reliable to fullfil a project of this dimension. Since the number of contibutors is significalty high and the size of Google is large enough, some of the problems listed below are surpassed. 

Benefits:
* The cost of accommodating changing customer requirements is reduced.
* Less documentation to change.
* Unstable requirements can be left for later stages of development.
* More frequent and early customer feedback.
* Customer value can be delivered with each increment so system functionality is available earlier.
* Early increments act as a prototype to help elicit requirements for later increments.
* Low risk of overall project failure.
* The highest priority system services tend to receive the most testing.

Problems:
* System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added.
* Unless time and money is spent on refactoring to improve the software, regular change tends to corrupt its structure. Incorporating
further software changes becomes increasingly difficult and costly.
* It can be hard to identify upfront common facilities that are needed by all increments, so level of reuse may be suboptimal.
* The nature of incremental development of the specification together with the software may be not be adequate for establishing a development contract at the begin.
