## Project description ##

[Bazel] (http://bazel.io/) is an open source project from Google aiming to provide faster _builds_ of software. It is still in _beta_, but the goal is to achieve a stable version in May of 2016. The full detailed roadmap can be checked [here] (http://bazel.io/roadmap.html).
+Everyone is welcome to support the project, but it is required to fulfill all the [requirements] (http://bazel.io/contributing.html). The programming language is [Skylark] (http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/concepts.html) which "is a superset of the core build language and its syntax is a subset of Python". When the project finishes, it will support [multiple programming languages] (http://bazel.io/docs/build-encyclopedia.html#Rules) (such as Java or C++). The _BUILD files_ are Python-like scripts. To get started, please check [here] (http://bazel.io/docs/getting-started.html) how to do it.

## Software Process ##

The software process used in Bazel project is "Incremental development and delivery". We chated with the contributors and they told us that [Bazaar model] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) is a good description, that usually fall under the "agile methodology" category. They also said that Google uses OKRs for planning and expressing what the company, a team and each individual engineer wants to focus on in the next quarter. We can find a good presentation about this process on the [Google Ventures] (http://www.gv.com/lib/how-google-sets-goals-objectives-and-key-results-okrs) website.
Incremental development and delevery process develop the system in increments and evaluate each increment before proceeding to the development of the next increment.
